// THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). 
// ANY USE REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS 
// AGREEMENT.
//
// 1. DEFINITIONS
//
// "Contribution" means:
// 
// a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this 
//    Agreement, and
// b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
//    i) changes to the Program, and
//   ii) additions to the Program;
//       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that 
//       particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the 
//       Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions
//       do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed
//       in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) //are not derivative
//       works of the Program.
//
// "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
// 
// "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the
// use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
//
// "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
// "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
//
// 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
//
// a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
//    worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
//    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
//    derivative works, in source code and object code form.
//
// b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, 
//    worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
//    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object
//    code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if,
//    at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
//    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
//    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
//
// c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth
//    herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or
//    other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
//    Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
//    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
//    hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
//    For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
//    it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
//
// d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution,
//    if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
//
// 3. REQUIREMENTS
//
// A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
// provided that:
//    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
//    b) its license agreement:
//       i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and
//          implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
//          or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
//      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
//          indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
//     iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone
//          and not by any other party; and
//      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees
//          how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
// When the Program is made available in source code form:
//    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
//    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
//
// Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
// 
// Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
// reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
//
// 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
//
// Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business
// partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
// Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
// create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
// commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
// every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses")
// arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor
// to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution
// of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
// Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
// Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
// Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
// settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
//
// For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor
// is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
// warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
// responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the
// other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
// Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
//
// 5. NO WARRANTY
//
// EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
// OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
// OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
// responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
// associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
// of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
// unavailability or interruption of operations.
//
// 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
// 
// EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY
// FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
// LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
// (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE
// OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
//
// 7. GENERAL
//
// If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
// validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
// parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
// and enforceable.
//
// If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
// lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
// infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as
// of the date such litigation is filed.
//
// All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms
// or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware
// of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
// distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
// and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
//
// Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the
// Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right
// to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
// Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse
// Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new
// version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
// always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
// version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
// under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
// licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
// estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
//
// This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States
// of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the
// cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
